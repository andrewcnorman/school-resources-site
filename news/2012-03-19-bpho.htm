<h1>AS Challenge</h1>

<p>Lower sixth physicists (some of whom also took part in the main olympiad for upper sixth students last term) were able to take part in their own "AS Challenge" this term, a national competition for students in year 12, giving them a chance to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the physics topics which they have met in their lessons, and show that they can solve challenging problems in unfamiliar contexts.  There was great interest and keenness to do this challenge, and several students attended some after-school training sessions beforehand.  Despite finding the paper on the day tricky, they rose to the challenge, and all deserve to be congratulated.</p>

<p>Particularly creditable performances were made by Lewis Black (12SWe), Will Fostier (12AJo), Jack Griffiths (12MNT), Tabitha Lord (12CBl), Charlotte Nolan (12CBl), Hannah Pointon (12CBl), James Ralph (12SWe), who all achieved a Bronze award in this competition.  Special mention must be made of Martin Sharp (13DHa), who was awarded a silver award, having started studying AS physics in upper sixth in addition to his other A-levels, and who currently holds a conditional offer of a place at Downing College, Cambridge to read Mathematics.</p>
