<h1>British Physics Olympiad</h1>

<p>The competitions run by the British physics olympiad (BPhO) committee offer students a chance to grapple with really interesting and open-ended physics questions.  The Heber has only recently started to take part in these competitions, and we are delighted that so many of our A-level physicists have chosen to take part in the A2 challenge.  Although this competition tests skills and knowledge from the A-level syllabus, the questions are of a different and more challenging nature, often using unfamiliar situations, or ideas from different areas of physics combined in one question.</p>

<p>Well done to all the students who took part, especially those from year 12 who to their credit decided to take on the challenge soon after starting their sixth form studies: Lizzi Bellman (13AVi), Lewis Black (12SWe), Josh Diamond (13DHa), Chris Duffy (13AVi), Marc Evans (12SWe), Adam Flanagan (13DHa), India Friswell (13CHe), Jack Griffiths (12MNT), Robbie Kerr (13AVi), Anna Lawrence (12SWe), Matt Lee (13MTa), Robert Morris (13DHa), James Ralph (12SWe), Charles Watson (13MTa), Tommy Williams (13BLo).</p>

<p>A special mention should go to Chris Duffy, who achieved a merit certificate, and will be entered for the first round to select the British team for the International Physics Olympiad, held in 2012 in Estonia.</p>

<p>We have also, for the first time this year, two students who have prepared entries for the BPhO experimental competition.  For this, students have to submit a write up of an investigation they have carried out using commonly available school and household equipment.  Congratulations to Cameron Cundill (10KLo) and Jack Griffiths (12MNT) who have both spent considerable time outside of lessons to put together an experimental report.</p>

<p>Mr. Norman</p>
