<h1>BPhO Competitions</h1>

<p>If you enjoy a challenge, and the chance to grapple with really interesting and open-ended physics questions, you might be interested in taking part in one or other of the competitions organized by the <a href="http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/olympiad/">British Physics Olympiad committee</a>.  Don't be afraid to have a go: there is no shame in taking part in these competitions, and you may just surprise yourself with how much you really do know!</p>

<h2>British Physics Olympiad (BPhO) [Y12-13]</h2>

<p>A2 Challenge: 9 September 2013 <!--(<strong>Thu 21 Oct</strong> at the Heber)--><br />
Round 1: 15 November 2013<br />
Round 2: <em>by invitation only</em></p>

<h2>BPhO Experimental Project [Y10-13]</h2>

<p>Submission deadline: 13 December 2013</p>

</ul>

<p>This is the BPhO committee's newest competition, started in 2007 in response to the decrease in practical physics available in schools.</p>

<p>Students are to submit a write up of an investigation they have carried out using commonly available school and household equipment.  The subject of the investigation is set by the BPhO committee, and the student should aim to push it as far as their experimental skills and physics knowledge allows.</p>

<p>Within each school teachers judge their students' efforts. Each school forwards their best project from each judging category to Dr Cyril Isenberg at the University of Kent, who selects the overall prize-winners.</p>

<p>There are two judging categories: one for years 12 and 13, and another for years 10 and 11.  Prizes are awarded to students with outstanding papers, and the very best papers are published in the Student e-journal www.youngscientists.co.uk.</p>

<!--This is a note to AS students in Year 12 who might be interested in putting together an experimental project.<br />

The experimental project would be an excellent thing for a good student to do.  Not only would it be a worthy endeavour in itself, but also it would be an excellent thing to put on UCAS forms this time next year - having gone above and beyond what is required.<br />

Please do not be discouraged from doing the experimental project if you don't know much about the topic.  If you are at all interested, I should strongly encourage you to come and talk to me about it.  We can arrange to go through some theory, and demonstrate some of the effects which you may find helpful for the project.<br />

<h2>BPhO AS Challenge [Y12]</h2>

<p>14 March 2014</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Training sessions:</strong> 7 February &amp; 13 March</dt>
<dd>These will be workshops looking at past problems, discussing approaches to solving the olympiad-style questions and hopefully whetting your appetite for the real thing!  One is just before the AS Challenge, and one is before half term, to give you some time to practise in between.</dd>
