<h1>Office Hours</h1>

<p>For my lessons and homeworks, I'm going to try out the American system of having "Office Hours" for the course - these are posted days and times someone who gives a college course can be expected to be in his/her office available to students.</p>

<br />
<hr />
<br />
<strong>From 20th September:</strong><br />
Office: Room 19<br />
Office Hours: Week two Tuesdays 3.45 to 5.0 p.m.<br />
<br />
<hr />
<br />

<p>You should feel free to use these times to come and address any difficulties which you might be having with my lessons or homeworks.  They are there to help you succeed in my lessons, understand the assignments, know what to expect on exams, and for me to get feedback when you're struggling.  However I do expect that students who show up for these hours have specific questions or concerns.</p>

<p>Remember these office hours are posted for your benefit.  If you are struggling and do not attend, I shall just sit in my office waiting to impart sage advice, give feedback, and offer more thorough explanations. I'm there to answer your questions and provide direction for you.</p>
