<h1>Recommended Books</h1>

<p>You will be provided by an <abbr title="Assessment and Qualifications Alliance">AQA</abbr>-endorsed <abbr title="Oxford University Press">OUP</abbr> textbook for A level physics, which contains the course content, and which we shall occasionally use in lessons and for homeworks.  Whilst this text is neither perfect nor infallible, it does have lots of exam-style questions, and tends to use the exam board vocabulary of terminology in the way that the eduqas examiners do!</p>

<p>I shall also be giving references both to relevant sections of this book, and to worked examples, which help explain or expand on the material presented in lessons.  Similarly, the question sheets may sometimes refer to the examples in these books for those who wish to try additional problems. This is to encourage you to develop your skills in utilizing the more extensive resource material provided in text-books to deepen your understanding of physics.</p>

<p>To this end, it is definitely worth consulting other sources of information apart from the Nelson Thornes textbook.  The internet is very good for physics information (if you find a good website, <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#65;&#67;&#78;&#46;&#78;&#111;&#114;&#109;&#97;&#110;&#64;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#108;&#101;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;&#46;&#117;&#107;">&#101;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#32;&#109;&#101;</a> so I can put it this site) and also there are other A-level textbooks available; some which I think are very clear and thorough are listed below.  Different textbooks suit different people, and indeed one might find an explanation of one thing better in one textbook, whilst another textbook is clearer for another area of physics.</p>

<ul>
<li>Duncan, Tom <cite>Advanced Physics</cite>, </li>
<li>Muncaster, R. <cite>A-level Physics</cite>, Nelson Thornes</li>
<li>Nelkon &amp; Parker <cite>Advanced Level Physics</cite>, Heinemann</li>
</ul>

<p>Some "quick reference books" are useful for revision purposes and help with formulae and mathematical work in the course are below.</p>

<ul>
<li>Chapple, Michael <cite>A-Z Physics Handbook</cite>, Hodder &amp; Staughton, 1997</li>
<li>Woan, Graham <cite>Cambridge Handbook of Physics Formulas</cite>, Cambridge University Prss, 2000</li>
<li>Lowe, T.L. &amp; Rounce, J.F. <cite>Calculations for A-level Physics</cite>, Nelson Thornes, 4th edtn. 2002</li>
</ul>

<p>There is certainly no need to go and spend large sums of money on additional textbooks or other reading material about physics, though.  Indeed, before buying a book for yourself, I recommend that you borrow it from a library so you can see whether or not you like the style.  Feel free to recommend them to the school library, or you can see the librarian to find out whether an inter-library loan can be arranged.</p>

<p>For each topic, I shall also try to recommend some books which I know to be good from outside the syllabus content, for those who are interested to explore a little further, which can only enrich and deepen your understanding.  Some general ideas for further reading are below (if you are wanting to read a particular book very badly, I have copies of some of the titles):</p>

<ul>
<li>Feynman, R P <cite>Six Easy Pieces</cite> Addison-Wesley</li>
<li>Feynman, R P <cite>The Character of Physical Law</cite> Addison-Wesley</li>
<li>Walker, J <cite>The Flying Circus of Physics</cite> Wiley</li>
<li>Davies, P C W(ed.) <cite>The New Physics</cite> Cambridge University Press</li>
<li>Fraser, G(ed.) <cite>The New Physics for the 21st Century</cite> Cambridge University Press</li>
<li>Lightman A <cite>Great Ideas in Physics</cite> McGray-Hill</li>
</ul>

<p>Happy reading!</p>
