<h1>How will prep be graded?</h1>

<h2>Effort based assessment</h2>

<p>The effort-based grading scale is P/D/F, with the following meanings:</p>
<table>
<tr valign="top">
<td align="center">P</td><td align="left">Decent effort</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td align="center">D</td><td align="left">Indecent effort</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td align="center">F</td><td align="left">No effort</td>
</tr>
</table>

<ul class="resources">

</ul>

<p>The assessment on work for my lessons is based not on correctness but on effort.  The reasons are several.  First, it would be absurd to grade on correctness since being wrong in physics is good for learning.  Second, effort is something over which you have full control, whereas correctness is much harder to control.  I therefore want to remove any anxiety based on the thought, <q>Did I get it
right or will I get slapped down with a bad grade?</q>  It interferes with learning a useful and enjoyable subject.</p>

<p>The general approach is outlined in <a href="../sixthform/exams.pdf">this paper</a> [PDF] by D.J.C. Mackay.</p>

<p>Note that if a question has one or a number of * before it then it contains points which are inherently difficult and which will be met more generally in subsequent years.</p>

<h3>Late work</h3>

<p>Work not handed in on time, without prior arrangement, will normally attract an 'F' grade and a detention in which to complete it.</p>

<p>That said, the world is messy.  Difficult circumstances arise.  Therefore, with a note from your tutor or a doctor's note, I shall postpone any deadline, no questions asked, for as long as seems reasonable in the circumstances.</p>
