<h1>Course Aims and Outcomes</h1>

<p>Here is a little about how I think about A-level physics teaching, and my ideas on putting together the physics course at A-level.</p>

<h2>Aims</h2>

<p>The main aims of the course are outlined below.</p>

<ol>
<li>To provide a course of elementary instruction in physics which will develop students existing knowledge, understanding and problem-solving techniques.</li>
<li>To give students a firm foundation for further study in physics (for example, those courses offered at the universities).</li>
<li>To prepare students for A-level examinations.</li>
</ol>

<p>The course is presented thoughout as though the students are going to go on to become physicists.  This is not the case of course, but I think is a good way to think about courses at A-level.</p>

<p>For this reason, the specification from <acronym title="Assessment and Qualifications Alliance">AQA</acronym> is seen as "mimimal for teaching, maximal for examining".  Whilst all of the material on the specification <em>will</em> be covered, there will be no hesitation about teaching any additional material which adds interest and generates understanding.</p>

<p>However, any non-examinable material will only be included in the compulsory parts of the course if it is directly relevant, not for its own sake alone.  In this regard, I am mindful of <cite>Victor Weisskopf</cite>, who said <q>it is better not to cover lots of material, but to uncover a little</q>.</p>

<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

<p>At the end of the course students should:</p>

<ol>
<li>have a knowledge and understanding of a range of elementary physics topics (these are closely defined by the <acronym title="Assessment and Qualifications Alliance">AQA</acronym> specification),</li>
<li>be able to solve physical problems based on the course material.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Teaching and learning methods</h2>

<p>These include "theory" lessons, practical lessons, homework problems, office hours, and occasional revision examples classes.</p>

<h2>Assessment</h2>

<p>Assessment for this course is through:</p>

<ul>
<li>Classroom engagement <em>light-touch</em></li>
<li>Homework <em>(light-touch: most people get a 'P')</em></li>
<li>Practical write-ups <em>(to exam-like mark scheme)</em></li>
<li>An "early hurdle" exam in October of the AS year</li>
<li>A mock exam in January of the AS year</li>
<li><strong>An <acronym title="Investigative Skills Assignment">ISA</acronym> controlled assessment</strong></li>
<li><strong>Two written papers on PHYA1 and PHYA2</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>For further details of assessment, <a href="./assessment.htm">see here</a>.</em></p>

<h2>Courses of Preparation</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Essential:</strong> GCSE Science &amp; Additional Science</li>
<li><strong>Recommended:</strong>
<ul>
<li>GCSE Physics</li>
<li>GCSE Mathematics</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
