<hr />

<p>London : September 10, 1829.</p>

<p>. . . My stay at the Taylors' was one of those times of 
which I shall never lose the flowery memory, and I shall always 
recollect the meadows and woods, the brook with its pebbles 
and rustling sound; we have become friends, I think, and I am 
truly fond of the girls, and believe that they like me too, for we 
were very happy together. I owe them three of my best piano
compositions. When the two younger sisters saw that I took 
the carnations and rose in earnest, and began to write music 
(of course in Susan's summer-house), the youngest came up with 
little yellow open bells in her hair, assuring me they were 
trumpets, and asking me whether I could not introduce them 
into the orchestra, as I had talked the other day of wanting new 
instruments ; .and when in the evening we danced to the miners' 
music and the trumpets were rather shrill, she gave it as her 
opinion that her trumpets would do better to dance to, so I 
wrote a dance for her but the yellow flower-bells supplied the 
music. And for the other sister I composed "The Rivulet," which 
had pleased us so much during our ride that we dismounted 
and sat down by it (I think I wrote about it to you). The last 
piece I believe is the best I have done in that way: it is so flowing 
and quiet, and drowsily simple, that I have played it to myself 
every day, and have got quite sentimental over it. I would 
send you the pieces, but as I hope to have my quartet finished 
by next post-day, and intend sending it you, and must bring 
home something new in December, I shall keep back my five 
pieces not fi lions,' as Rebecca calls them, but 'darlings' of 
mine. One of them I have not even got in manuscript. 
Yes, children, you may be scandalised, I do nothing but flirt, 
and that in English. But seriously, it was a happy time, and 
passed very quickly. I drove away in the evening; the 
lights in the house sparkled through the bushes in the 
distance; in my open carriage I passed by several favourite 
places, the gentle brook already mentioned, the last hedge of 
the property, and then off I went at furious English speed. I 
snubbed all my travelling companions, spoke not a word, but 
kept quiet, half dreaming, half thinking, a little gloomy, just as 
I think one always is when one. goes along two hundred miles in 
a mail. It appeared almost like a magic-lantern of chance when 
on the second evening of my journey (I travelled right through, 
in order to reach London in the morning) the mail stopped, 
because it met the mail from London to Chester, and, putting 
my head out of the window while the two coachmen were 
talking, I saw peeping out of the other mail Fr. Cramer and 
his daughter (you remember Miss Marian?). Exchange a few 
words, then drive asunder, and part for years or longer such 
is the world ; moving onwards, meeting, coming near, and going 
far away. On my arrival in London I resumed my quiet life, 
which consists in writing music and reading English. My 
quartet is now in the middle of the last movement, and I think 
will be completed in a few days; so will be the organ piece for 
the wedding. Then (D.V.) I shall begin my Reformation-symphony, the Scotch symphony, and Hebrides matter, all shaping 
themselves gradually. Vocal music too moves in my head, but 
I shall take good care not to say what kind and how. The 
Clementis sent me back on the day of my arrival the same beautiful piano I had during my former stay; and as I asked Mr. 
Collard to let me have it on hire this time, he sent me a few 
English verses and begged me to set them to music. This is 
hard for me, but I must.</p>

<hr />

<p>The following letter, written after his death by a member 
of the Taylor family, gives a very good idea of the impression 
Felix made on his hospitable friends at Coed Du.</p> 

<p>It was in the year 1829 that we first became acquainted with Mr. Mendelssohn. He was introduced to us by my aunt Mrs. Austin, who had well known his cousin Professor Mendelssohn at Bonn. 
He visited us early in the season in Bedford Bow, but our real friendship began at Coed Du, which was a house near Mold in Flintshire, rented for many years by my 
father, Mr. John Taylor.</p>

<p>Mr. Mendelssohn came down there to spend a little time 
with us, in the course of a tour in England and Scotland. 
My father and mother received him kindly, as they did every- 
body ; but his arrival created no particular sensation, as many 
strangers came to our house to see the mines under my father's 
management, and foreigners were often welcomed there. Soon, 
however, we began to find that a most accomplished mind had 
come among us, quick to observe, delicate to distinguish. We 
knew little about his music, but the wonder of it grew upon us; 
and I remember one night, when my two sisters and I went to 
our room, how we began saying to each other: "Surely this 
must be a man of genius. ... we can't be mistaken about the 
music ; never did we hear any one play so before. Yet we know 
the best London musicians. Surely by-and-by we shall hear that 
Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy is a great name in the world."</p>

<p>My father's birthday happened while Mr. Mendelssohn was 
with us. There was a grand expedition to a distant mine, up 
among the hills ; a tent carried up there, a dinner to the miners. 
We had speeches and health-drinkings, and Mendelssohn 
threw himself into the whole thing as if he had been one of 
us. He interested himself in hearing about the condition and 
way of life of the Welsh miners. Nothing was lost upon him. 
A letter that he wrote to my brother John just after he left 
Coed Du charmingly describes the impressions he carried away 
of that country. Sometimes he would go out sketching with 
us girls, sitting down very seriously to draw, but making the 
greatest fun of attempts which he considered to be unsuc- 
cessful. One figure of a Welsh girl he imagined to be like a 
camel, and she was called c the camel accordingly. Though he 
scorned his own drawings, he had the genuine artist-feeling, 
and great love for pictures. I need not say how deeply he 
entered imto the beauty of the hills and the woods. His way of 
representing them was not with the pencil ; but in the evening 
his improvised music would show what he had observed or felt 
in the past day. The piece called "The Rivulet," which he 
wrote at that time for my sister Susan, will show what I mean : 
it was a recollection of a real actual rivulet.</p>

<p>We observe how natural objects seemed to suggest music to 
him. There was in my sister Honora's garden a pretty creeping 
plant, new at the time, covered with little trumpet-like flowers. 
He was struck with it, and played for her the music which (he 
said) the fairies might play on those trumpets. When he wrote 
out the piece (called a capriccio in E minor) he drew a little 
branch of that flower all up the margin of the paper.</p>

<p>The piece (an Andante and Allegro) which Mr. Mendelssohn 
wrote for me was suggested by the sight of a bunch of carnations and roses. The carnations that year were very fine with 
us. He liked them best of all the flowers, would have one 
often in his button-hole. We found he intended the arpeggio  
passages in that composition as a reminder of the sweet scent 
of the flower rising up.</p>

<p>Mr. Mendelssohn was not a bit sentimental, though he had 
so much sentiment. Nobody enjoyed fun more than he, and 
his laughing was the most joyous that could be. One evening 
in hot summer we stayed in the wood above our house later than 
usual. We had been building a house of fir branches in Susan's 
garden up in the wood. We made a fire a little way off it 
in a thicket among the trees, Mendelssohn helping with the 
utmost zeal, dragging up more and more wood ; we tired our- 
selves with our merry work ; we sat down round our fire, the 
smoke went off, the ashes were glowing, it began to get dark, but 
we could not like to leave our bonfire. "If we had but some 
music," Mendelssohn said, "Could anybody get something to 
play on ?" Then my brother recollected that we were near the 
gardener's cottage, and that the gardener had a fiddle. Off rushed 
our boys to get the fiddle. When it came it was the wretchedest 
thing in the world, and it had but one string. Mendelssohn 
took the instrument into his hands, and fell into fits of laughter 
over it when he heard the sounds it made. His laughter was 
very catching, he put us all into peals of merriment. But he 
somehow afterwards brought beautiful music out of the poor 
old fiddle, and we sat listening to one strain after another, till 
the darkness sent us home. </p>

<p>My cousin John Edward Taylor was staying with us at 
that time. He had composed an imitation Welsh air, and he 
was hefore breakfast playing this over, all unconscious that Mr. 
Mendelssohn (whose bedroom was next the drawing-room) was 
hearing every note. That night, when we had music as usual, 
Mr. Mendelssohn sat down to play. After an elegant prelude, 
and with all possible advantage, John Edward heard his poor 
little air introduced as the subject of the evening. And having 
dwelt upon it, and adorned it in every graceful manner, 
Mendelssohn in his pretty playful way, bowing to the composer, 
gave all the praise to him. </p>

<p>I suppose some of the charm of his speech might lie in the 
unusual choice of words which he, as a German, made in 
speaking English. He lisped a little. He used an action of 
nodding his head quickly, till the long locks of hair would fall 
over his high forehead with the vehemence of his assent to any- 
thing he liked. </p>

<p>Sometimes he used to talk very seriously with my mother. 
Seeing that we brothers and sisters lived lovingly together and 
with our parents, he spoke about this to my mother, told her 
how he had known families where it was not so, and used the 
words, ' You know not how happy you are.' </p>

<p>He was so far away from any sort of pretension, or from 
making a favour of giving his music to us, that one evening 
when the family from a neighbouring house came to dinner, 
and we had dancing afterwards, he took his turn in playing 
quadrilles and waltzes with the others. He was the first person 
who taught us gallopades, and he first played us Weber's last 
waltz. He enjoyed dancing like any other young man of his 
age. He was then twenty years old. He had written his 
4 Midsummer-night's Dream' (Overture) before that time. I 
well remember his playing it. He left Coed Du early in Sep- 
tember 1829. </p>

<p>We saw Mr. Mendelssohn whenever he came to England, 
but the visits he made to us in London have not left so much 
impression on me as that one at Coed Du did, I can, however 
call to mind a party at my father's in Bedford Kow, where he 
was present. Sir George Smart was there also. When the latter 
was asked to play, he said to my mother, "No, no, don't call 
upon the old post-horse when you have a high-mettled young 
racer at hand," The end of it was a duet played by Sir 
George and Mr. Mendelssohn together. Our dear old -master, 
Mr. Attwood, often met him at our house. Once he went with 
us to a ball at Mr. Attwood's at Norwood. Eeturning by day- 
light, I remember how Mr. Mendelssohn admired the view of 
St. Paul's in the early dawn, which we got from Blackfriars 
Bridge. But the happiest visit to us was that one when he 
first brought his sweet young wife to see my mother. Madame 
Felix Mendelssohn was a bride then, and we all of us said he 
could not have found one more worthy of himself. And with 
the delightful remembrance of his happiness then I will end 
these fragments.</p> 

<p>In London Felix was upset from a carriage on September 17, 
and injured his knee so seriously that all his plans were 
destroyed, and his departure from England was delayed for two 
months, until the end of November. He had intended to meet 
his father in Holland and travel back with him through 
Holland and Belgium, to be present at Fanny's wedding on the 
3rd of October. Instead of that a long and painful illness kept 
him in London, which, however, was relieved and sweetened 
by the devoted love of Klingemann, who went at once to stay 
with him, and by the friendship and sympathy of all his 
English acquaintances. </p>
