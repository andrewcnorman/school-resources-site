<p>Dear Parishioner,<br />
<br />
POSSIBLE SITING OF INDUSTRIAL WIND TURBINES AT BICKERTON<br />
<br />
You will be aware that there is a meeting of the Bulkeley and Ridley Parish Council on the 18th June to discuss and confirm a view on whether the Council should oppose or support the siting of industrial wind turbines in Bickerton.  This meeting is potentially very important and we are very grateful to the Council for this opportunity to present the arguments in a balanced way.<br />
<br />
Traditionally, wind turbines have been viewed favourably both by the media and and by people who have seen earlier generations of relatively small turbines.<br />
<br />
However, the experience of families living in the vicinity of large industrial wind turbines in other parts of the UK and in other countries has highlighted a number of serious problems relating to local amenities including landscape, noise and health.<br />
<br />
Authoritative, independent bodies such as the Renewable Energy Foundation are seriously questioning the value of the contribution that industrial wind turbines can make to the UK's energy needs.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the Advertising Standards Authority have successfully challenged the exaggerated carbon dioxide saving claims that until recently were being made by the British Wind Energy Association.<br />
<br />
In the UK, over 200 local communities have listened to the pros and cons of industrial wind turbines and are now challenging such developments in their neighbourhoods.<br />
<br />
The meeting on Thursday 18th June is an important opportunity to hear an up to date account of the issues and reach a balanced view.  The decision of the meeing is important not only for you but also your children and not only for Bickerton but for all our neighbouring Parishioners.  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">We very much hope that you can be there.</span><br />
